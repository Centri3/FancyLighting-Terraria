This mod makes lighting fancier by adding smooth lighting, ambient occlusion, dynamic shadows, overbright rendering, simulated normal maps, and new sky colors.

This mod will only take effect if lighting is set to color, and features can be individually enabled and disabled. There are a number of presets included to make this process easier.

Presets (from fastest/lowest quality to slowest/highest quality):
- Disable All
- Fast
- Default
- Quality
- Ultra (good CPU and GPU recommended)

Because smooth lighting overrides built-in tile light rendering, glowmasks and tiles that glow independently of the light they emit must be re-implemented. The following effects and glowing tiles are supported:
- Spelunker Potion
- Dangersense Potion
- Crystal Shard and Gelatin Crystal
- Glowing Moss
- Meteorite Brick
- Martian Conduit Plating (partial)
- Lava Lamp
Effects and glowing tiles from other mods may not work properly with smooth lighting.

Requires OpenGL 2.1 or later

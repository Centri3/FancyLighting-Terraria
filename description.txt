This mod makes lighting fancier by adding smooth lighting, ambient occlusion, dynamic shadows, overbright rendering, simulated normal maps, and new sky colors.

This mod will only take effect if lighting is set to color, and features can be toggled individually. There are a number of presets included to make this process easier.

Presets (from fastest/lowest quality to slowest/highest quality):
- Disable All
- Fast
- Default
- Quality
- Ultra

Some features may significantly lower frame rates at resolutions above 1920x1200 if you don't have a powerful GPU. If you experience this issue, try lowering the in-game resolution.

Because smooth lighting overrides built-in tile light rendering, glowmasks and tiles that glow without being light sources must be re-implemented.

Supported effects and glowing tiles:
- Spelunker Potion
- Dangersense Potion
- Crystal Shard and Gelatin Crystal
- Glowing Moss
- Meteorite Brick
- Martian Conduit Plating (partial)
- Lava Lamp

Effects and glowing tiles from other mods may not work properly with smooth lighting.

Requires OpenGL 2.1 or later

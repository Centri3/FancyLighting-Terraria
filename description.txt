This mod makes lighting fancier by adding smooth lighting and ambient occlusion. There is also a new lighting engine with directional shadows that can be manually enabled in the config for this mod.

This mod will only take effect if lighting is set to color, and features can be individually enabled and disabled. A relatively powerful CPU is recommended to run this mod's features smoothly.

Smooth lighting is compatible with effects such as illuminant paint and the spelunker and dangersense potions, along with glowing tiles such as crystal shards and glowing moss. Effects and glowing blocks from other mods may not work.

Requires OpenGL 2.1 or later

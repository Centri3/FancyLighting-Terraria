Fancy Lighting makes lighting look fancier. A variety of options and presets are available to configure the performance and quality of this mod.

Features:
- Smooth lighting
- Ambient occlusion
- Dynamic shadows
- Overbright rendering
- Simulated normal maps
- New sky colors

This mod only takes effect when the lighting mode is set to color.

Some features may significantly lower frame rates at resolutions above 1920x1200 on machines with less powerful GPUs. If you are experiencing performance issues and are running the game at a resolution above 1920x1200, try lowering the resolution.

Because smooth lighting overrides the built-in tile lighting, glow masks and other glowing effects must be re-implemented. Most effects from vanilla are supported, but modded effects may not work.

Supported Glowing Effects and Tiles:
- Spelunker Potion
- Dangersense Potion
- Shimmer
- Crystal Shard and Gelatin Crystal
- Glowing Moss
- Meteorite Brick
- Martian Conduit Plating (partial)
- Lava Lamp

Unsupported Glowing Effects and Tiles (vanilla):
- Ash tree trunk

Glowing tile entities should work correctly. This mod also does not alter the lighting of NPCs and projectiles.

Minimum Graphics API: Direct3D 11 or OpenGL 3.0

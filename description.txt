This mod makes lighting fancier by adding smooth lighting and ambient occlusion. There is also a new lighting engine that makes light cast shadows in the correct directions.

This mod will only take effect if lighting is set to color, and features can be individually enabled and disabled. A relatively powerful CPU is recommended to run this mod's features smoothly.

Because smooth lighting overrides built-in tile light rendering, glowmasks and tiles that glow independently of the light they emit must be re-implemented. The following effects and glowing tiles are supported:
- Spelunker Potion
- Dangersense Potion
- Crystal Shard and Gelatin Crystal
- Glowing Moss
- Meteorite Brick
- Martian Conduit Plating (partial)
- Lava Lamp
Effects and glowing tiles from other mods may not work properly with smooth lighting.

Requires OpenGL 2.1 or later
